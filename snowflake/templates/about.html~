<h1>About</h1>
</br>
<p>Whenever I write, I feel better. And yet, I find it so hard to get myself to write. This is a humble attempt to get myself to write more.
</br></br>
I'm also interested in fostering intimate communication. Life's short so we should get down to the important stuff sooner rather than later. And yet we often skip the important stuff or refuse to share it with each other. This is a humble attempt to encourage sharing.
</br></br>
The site is deliberately simple. It encourages anonymity and exclusiveness, not for their own sake but to encourage people to participate in the community. Throw a thought or response or answer out there. No judgment will come. Only those that participate can see your response and they wonâ€™t know you wrote it anyway.
