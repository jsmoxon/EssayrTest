Essayr (available at http://www.essayr.com) is my first coding project. My friend Peter
and I used it as a way to teach ourselves to program. It's written with Python and the Django framework. 

The goal of the site is to create an earnest writing forum where people can post and respond thoughtfully
to questions from one another. Anonymity allows for complete honesty and the goal is to create a mosaic of 
stories that are interesting for people to read. We have a few friends using the site currently. 

I'm proud of it becuase prior to working on this site I had no prior programming experience. The site and idea
still have a long way to go, but I'll never forget how satisfied I was when I built it and was able to share it 
with friends.
